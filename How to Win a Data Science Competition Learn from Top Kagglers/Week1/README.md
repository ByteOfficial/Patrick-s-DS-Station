# Learning summary for Week 1

-------

## What covered in this week's video and materials
1. Competition mechanics
2. Recap of main ML algorithms, tree based models & non-tree based models, the differences between different tree-based models.
3. Software/Hardware requirements
4. Feature Preprocessing and Generation with Respect to Models. How to deal with numerical features, categorical features, datetime and coordinates features, how to handle missing values.
5. Feature extraction from text and images: bag of words, Word2vec & CNN
6. Final project description.

## Notes:
* The coding assignment is not easy.
* The quiz 7 and quiz 9 need more attention.

## What I learned from week1
* Learned how to deal with categorial features in different models, when to use label encoding and one-hot encoding in tree based and non tree based models.
* Learned the differences between different feature scaling techniques, learned how to deal with outliers in numerical features.
* Recapped the using of datetime in Pandas.
* Understand the bag of words and word embeddings.
